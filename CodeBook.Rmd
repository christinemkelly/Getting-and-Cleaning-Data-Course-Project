                Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This document supports the course project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Project Purpose: To collect, work with, clean a data set and produce a tidy dataset.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Background: The underlying data for this project were signals collected while
participants underwent everyday activities. Wearing a Smartphone embedded with an accelerometer
and a gyroscope, signals were sent, received and pre-processed into a "feature" which 
describes a specific aspect of a participant's motion while walking, climbing stairs, etc. Raw
signals are found in the dataset's InertialSignals folder; those signals were pre-processed (as
described in the ReadMe file with the dataset) into 561 features, such as "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z", the mean of the time-based body acceleration in the Z-axis. 

This project focused on the subject, the activities and the features data only. There were 30
participants, divided randomly into two groups: test and training.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Data Source and Composition: 
The data were found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The contents are:
    subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt: contains a value of 1-30 identifying the subjec t
            /participant.
    X_test.txt and X_train.txt: contains the features as described above
    y_test.txt and y_train.txt: contains a value of 1-6 identifying the activity
    activities_labels: names the 6 activities
    features.txt: names the 561 features
    featues_info.txt: describes the features
    features.txt
    
    Two folders containing the Inertial Signal for both test and train. None of the files 
    contained within were used in the data analysis project.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Approach

1. Download the data to a local directory; look at the directory structue and the file
   composition.
2. Read the data into R; check for NAs.
3. Join the test and train files for subject, activity and feature files. Improve the 
   readability by replacing the existing generic column labels (V1, V2, etc) with descriptive 
   labels as well as the numeric designator for the activity with the name of the activity.
4. Combine these three files into a master dataframe for possible future use.
5. Accomplish the data analysis:
   5.1: Pull out the mean and standard deviation columns according to the assignment 
        and combine into one data frame; join with the subject and activity labeled files.
   5.2: Create a tidy data set that finds the average of the mean and the standard deviation
        for each feature associated with an activity for each participant.
6. Write out the results.
